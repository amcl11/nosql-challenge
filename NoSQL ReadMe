# NoSQL Challenge - Module 12 Data Analytics Bootcamp 

## Project Description: 

For this week's challenge we used our knowledge of MongoDB and PyMongo to perform data cleaning and analysis on UK Food Establishments data. 

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. In this hypothetical analysis, we have been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, "Eat Safe, Love", to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.


### Part 1 - Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up üçîüçï:

Jupyter Notebook code file: [NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb](https://github.com/amcl11/nosql-challenge/blob/main/NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb)

Section 1 requires Splinter, BeautifulSoup, JSON, and Chrome DevTools.

The final output for Part 1 includes the Mars news article titles and previews stored in the [news_data.json](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/news_data.json) file.

### Part 2 - Scraping the [Mars weather data website](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html) ü™ê‚òÄÔ∏èüå¶Ô∏è:

Jupyter Notebook code file: [part_2_mars_weather.ipynb](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)

Section 2 requires Splinter, Beautiful Soup, Matplotlib, and Pandas. 

The final scraped weather data is stored in the CSV file [mars_analysis.csv](https://github.com/amcl11/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/mars_analysis.csv)
